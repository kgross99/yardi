README for the threaded proxy program skelton:

Install:
add .java files to folder or to eclipse
compile

Demo instructions:

Summary:
In four separate terminal windows in the compile folder:
  $ java ProxyForThings -2
  $ java Browser 127.0.0.1 8080 1
  $ java Aft 8082
  $ java Aft 8081

Then run:
  $ java Browser 127.0.0.1 8080 2
  $ java Aft 8081
  $ java Aft 8082

  Done.

  ProxyForThings will timeout after a  minute.
  The Aft programs run and stop immeditately.
  The Browser stops after the Aft with the matching
    number runs.
  The matching number means the last digit of the port
    number of the Aft. 8081 and 1. 8082 and 2.

Details:

1) in a separate terminal window in the compile folder:
   run proxy server:
   $ java ProxyForThings -2
   -2 means:
   two afts may be used.
   negative sign means debugging messages will be seen

2) in a separate terminal window in the compile folder:
   run browser:
   $ java Browser 127.0.0.1 8080 1
   127.0.0.1 8080 means connect to proxy on localhost port 8080
   1 means get resource from aft id # 1

3) in a separate terminal window in the compile folder:
   run aft id # 2 (yes, 2)
   $ java Aft 8082
   8082 is the port number for Aft #2
   notice that the proxy displays messages from aft #2, but the
   browser doesn't respond.

4) in a separate terminal window in the compile folder:
   run aft id # 1 (now, run aft# 1)
   $ java Aft 8081
   8081 is the port number for Aft #1
   notice that the proxy displays messages from aft #1, and the
   browser responds with the message from aft # 1.
   
5) run the browser with 2 instead of 1
   $ java Browser 127.0.0.1 8080 2
   run aft# 1, see that browser doesn't respond
   run aft# 2, see that browser responds.
